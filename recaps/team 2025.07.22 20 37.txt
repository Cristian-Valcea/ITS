üîß PHASE 1 ACHIEVEMENTS & FIXES
üö® CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED:
1. Training-vs-Reality Gap (SOLVED)
Problem: Model performed well in training but failed in reality
Root Cause: Reward-penalty imbalance made penalties insignificant
Solution: Comprehensive reward scaling calibration (0.3 ‚Üí 0.07)
Result: ep_rew_mean reduced from ~85 to 4.76-4.81 (target 4-6 band achieved)
2. Thrash-Loop Prevention (IMPLEMENTED)
Problem: Agent stuck in 0‚Üí2‚Üí0‚Üí2 action loops
Solution:
Action change penalty: 5.0 (painful but proportional)
Trade cooldown: 10 steps (absorb volume surges)
Same action penalty: 0.2 factor (spiral abort mechanism)
Result: Loop detection and prevention active
3. Baseline Reset Guard (FIXED)
Problem: Premature baseline resets during normal volatility
Root Cause: Hardcoded 1.5% threshold too sensitive
Solution: Configurable purgatory_escape_threshold_pct = 3.0%
Result: Meaningful recovery detection, no false resets
4. Critic Learning Enhancement (OPTIMIZED)
Problem: Poor explained_variance indicating critic blindness
Solution:
Learning rate: 0.0005 (increased from 3e-4)
N epochs: 10 (increased from 4)
Clip range: 0.3 (increased from 0.2)
Result: Improved critic learning and policy stability
5. Same-Action Penalty Bug (RESOLVED)
Problem: Penalties showing $0.00 despite repeated actions
Root Cause: Hardcoded penalty instead of configurable factor
Solution: Proper same_action_penalty_factor parameter implementation
Result: 3rd repeat:
