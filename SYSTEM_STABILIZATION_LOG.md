# System Stabilization Log

**Date:** July 20, 2025  
**Objective:** Fix excessive penalties causing money loss and system instability  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - All penalty systems disabled for basic PnL training

---

## Issues Identified

### 1. **ZeroDivisionError Crash**
- **Location:** `src/gym_env/components/turnover_penalty.py:229`
- **Cause:** Division by zero when `normalized_turnover = 0`
- **Impact:** Evaluation crashes, preventing model assessment

### 2. **Over-Penalization Money Loss** 
- **Symptoms:** Portfolio declining from 50k → 48k range
- **Cause:** Multiple penalty systems active simultaneously
- **Impact:** Agent learns "never trade" instead of profitable trading

### 3. **Observation Space Mismatch**
- **Training:** (5,12) features (base + risk features)
- **Evaluation:** (5,7) features (base only)
- **Impact:** Model loading failures, inconsistent behavior

### 4. **Aggressive Drawdown Termination**
- **Settings:** 2% daily limit, 50 consecutive steps
- **Impact:** Premature episode termination, limited learning

## Files Modified & Features Disabled

### 📄 **config/emergency_fix_orchestrator_gpu.yaml**

**Penalty Systems Disabled:**
```yaml
# BEFORE → AFTER
use_emergency_reward_fix: true → false          # Disabled emergency penalties
use_turnover_penalty: true → false              # Disabled turnover penalty system
ppo_reward_scaling: true → false                # Disabled reward amplification
ppo_scale_factor: 1000.0 → 1.0                 # No reward scaling

# Risk Features Disabled:
include_risk_features: true → false             # Fixes observation space mismatch

# Drawdown Limits Relaxed:
max_daily_drawdown_pct: 0.05 → 0.15            # 5% → 15% (more forgiving)
```

### 📄 **config/risk_limits.yaml**

**Risk Controls Disabled:**
```yaml
# BEFORE → AFTER
max_daily_drawdown_pct: 0.02 → 0.50            # 2% → 50% (essentially disabled)
env_turnover_penalty_factor: 0.01 → 0.0        # Disabled turnover penalties
halt_on_breach: true → false                   # Disabled system halting
```

### 📄 **src/gym_env/components/turnover_penalty.py**

**Crash Fix Applied:**
```python
# Line 229 - Added zero-check to prevent ZeroDivisionError
# BEFORE:
f"Improvement: {old_ratio/normalized_turnover:.1f}x reduction"

# AFTER:
f"Improvement: {old_ratio/normalized_turnover:.1f}x reduction" if normalized_turnover > 0 else f"Improvement: No trading (infinite reduction)"
```

### 📄 **src/gym_env/intraday_trading_env.py**

**Drawdown Limits Relaxed:**
```python
# Line 207 - Increased consecutive drawdown limit
# BEFORE:
self.max_consecutive_drawdown_steps = 50

# AFTER:
self.max_consecutive_drawdown_steps = 200  # Increase limit during stabilization
```

### 📄 **start_training_clean.bat**

**Config File Selection Fixed:**
```batch
# BEFORE: Used turnover_penalty_orchestrator_gpu.yaml (with penalties)
# AFTER: Forced use of emergency_fix_orchestrator_gpu.yaml (penalties disabled)

REM FORCE USE OF STABILIZED EMERGENCY FIX CONFIG (penalties disabled)
set CONFIG_FILE=emergency_fix_orchestrator_gpu.yaml
echo ✅ Using STABILIZED emergency fix configuration (penalties disabled)
```

## Systems Now Disabled

### ❌ **Penalty Systems**
- ✅ Emergency reward fix penalties
- ✅ Sophisticated turnover penalty system  
- ✅ PPO reward scaling amplification
- ✅ Hourly turnover cap penalties ($50-70 per step)
- ✅ Exponential turnover penalties

### ❌ **Risk Management Overrides**
- ✅ Risk feature observations (observation space mismatch)
- ✅ Aggressive drawdown termination (2% → 50% limit)
- ✅ System halting on risk breaches
- ✅ Consecutive drawdown step limits (50 → 200)

### ❌ **Complex Reward Shaping**
- ✅ Multi-layered penalty calculations
- ✅ Curriculum learning penalty escalation
- ✅ Volatility penalty systems
- ✅ Dynamic weight factor adjustments

---

## Current System Behavior

### ✅ **Active Components**
- **Basic PnL Calculation:** Pure profit/loss based rewards
- **Transaction Costs:** 0.01% (0.0001) standard trading costs
- **Position Sizing:** 25% of capital per position
- **Episode Management:** 20,000 max steps per episode

### ✅ **Learning Focus**
- **Profitable Trading Patterns:** Agent learns to maximize PnL
- **Basic Risk Awareness:** Natural learning from drawdowns
- **Market Timing:** When to enter/exit positions
- **Cost Efficiency:** Minimizing unnecessary trades through natural selection

---

## Expected Training Results

### 📈 **Portfolio Behavior**
- **No Money Loss:** Portfolio should maintain or grow from 50k starting capital
- **Stable Trading:** Fewer but more deliberate trading decisions
- **Natural Learning:** Agent discovers profitable patterns without penalties

### 📊 **Training Metrics**
- **Longer Episodes:** 30-200 episodes (vs previous 2-6)
- **Positive Rewards:** Episodes should show positive average returns
- **Stable Volatility:** 1-5% daily volatility (natural market movement)
- **No Crashes:** Clean evaluation runs without ZeroDivisionError

### 🎯 **Agent Behavior**
- **Smart Trading:** Quality over quantity approach
- **Market Adaptation:** Learning optimal entry/exit timing
- **Cost Awareness:** Natural reduction in excessive trading
- **Profitability Focus:** Rewarded for making money, not avoiding penalties

---

## Monitoring Guidelines

### 🔍 **Key Metrics to Watch**
1. **Portfolio Value:** Should remain ≥ 50,000 (starting capital)
2. **Episode Length:** Should train for full episodes (not early termination)
3. **Average Reward:** Should trend positive over time
4. **Log Messages:** No more "Applied drawdown penalty" or "turnover cap breached"

### ⚠️ **Warning Signs**
- Portfolio consistently declining below 49,500
- Episodes terminating after <100 steps
- Continued penalty messages in logs
- "Emergency" markers in log output

### 🚀 **Success Indicators**
- Portfolio growing or stable around 50k+
- Episodes completing full duration
- Positive average episode rewards
- Clean log output without penalty messages

## Re-enabling Features (Future Steps)

**Once system is stable and profitable:**

1. **Phase 1:** Re-enable basic risk features
   ```yaml
   include_risk_features: true  # Add risk observations back
   ```

2. **Phase 2:** Add gentle turnover guidance
   ```yaml
   use_turnover_penalty: true
   turnover_target_ratio: 0.02  # Very relaxed 2% target
   turnover_weight_factor: 0.0001  # Very small penalty
   ```

3. **Phase 3:** Restore normal drawdown limits
   ```yaml
   max_daily_drawdown_pct: 0.05  # Back to 5% limit
   ```

4. **Phase 4:** Enable advanced reward shaping
   ```yaml
   use_emergency_reward_fix: false
   advanced_reward_shaping: true
   ```

---

## Emergency Rollback

**If issues persist, further simplification:**

```yaml
# Minimal configuration - pure trading only
initial_capital: 50000.0
position_sizing_pct_capital: 0.10  # Reduce position size
reward_scaling: 1.0
trade_cooldown_steps: 5  # Add small cooldown
max_episode_steps: 5000  # Shorter episodes for faster iteration

# Disable ALL optional features
use_emergency_reward_fix: false
use_turnover_penalty: false
include_risk_features: false
ppo_reward_scaling: false
```
