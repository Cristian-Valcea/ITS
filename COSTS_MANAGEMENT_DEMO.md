```

### **Phase 2: Evidence-Based Scaling Decision (Month 2)**
**Trigger Analysis**: Generate comprehensive slippage report after 30 days
```python
# Slippage Analysis Metrics
def analyze_scaling_need():
    slippage_cost = calculate_execution_slippage()
    symbol_count = len(active_trading_symbols)
    
    # Upgrade triggers
    if slippage_cost > 170:  # Real-time data pays for itself
        return "UPGRADE_TO_ADVANCED"
    elif symbol_count >= 10:  # Portfolio expansion needs
        return "UPGRADE_TO_ADVANCED" 
    else:
        return "STAY_ON_STARTER"  # Lean approach working
```
