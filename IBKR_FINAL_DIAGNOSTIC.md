# üîç **IBKR FINAL DIAGNOSTIC**

**Status**: TCP connection works, but API handshake fails  
**This means**: IBKR Workstation is receiving connections but not responding to API protocol

---

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE CHECKS**

### **1. Check IBKR Workstation Status Bar**
Look at the **bottom-right corner** of IBKR Workstation window:
- Should show: `API: Ready` or `API: Listening on port 7497`
- If shows: `API: Disabled` ‚Üí API settings didn't save properly
- If shows: `API: Error` ‚Üí There's a configuration problem

### **2. Check for API Permission Dialog**
Sometimes IBKR shows a popup when first API connection is attempted:
- Look for any **popup dialogs** about API access
- May need to **"Allow" or "Accept"** API connections
- Dialog might be **hidden behind other windows**

### **3. Account Type Verification**
In IBKR Workstation, verify:
- **Account type**: Should show "Paper" or "Simulated" 
- **Account status**: Should be fully logged in (not "Offline" or "Connecting")
- **Data subscriptions**: Should have basic market data permissions

### **4. Try Different API Port**
Some paper trading accounts use different ports:
```bash
# Test port 4002 (IB Gateway paper trading port)
nc -zv 172.24.32.1 4002

# Test port 7496 (live trading port - should be closed)
nc -zv 172.24.32.1 7496
```

### **5. Check IBKR Log Files**
IBKR creates log files on Windows:
```
C:\Users\[YourUsername]\Documents\IBLogs\
```
Look for recent `.log` files with API connection errors.

## üß™ **ALTERNATIVE TESTING**

### **Test with IB Gateway Instead of Workstation**
If available, try **IB Gateway** instead of IBKR Workstation:
1. Close IBKR Workstation
2. Start IB Gateway (separate application)
3. Use port 4002 for paper trading
4. Test connection again

### **Test from Windows Directly**
To isolate WSL/network issues:
1. Install Python on Windows
2. Install ib_insync: `pip install ib_insync`
3. Test connection from Windows localhost (127.0.0.1)

## üîß **COMMON SOLUTIONS**

### **Solution 1: Reset API Configuration**
1. **Uncheck** "Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients"
2. **Click OK** and close configuration
3. **Reopen** API settings
4. **Re-check** "Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients"  
5. **Add trusted IPs again**: `172.24.46.63`
6. **Restart** IBKR Workstation

### **Solution 2: Different Client Authentication**
Some accounts require authentication even for paper trading:
```bash
# Add credentials to .env file (if you have them)
IB_USERNAME=your_username
IB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### **Solution 3: Alternative Port Configuration**
Try these ports in .env:
```bash
# For IB Gateway paper trading
IBKR_PORT=4002

# For TWS live (if accidentally in live mode)
IBKR_PORT=7496
```

## üìû **ESCALATION PATH**

If none of the above work:

1. **Contact IBKR Support**: Ask specifically about "API access for paper trading accounts"
2. **Check account permissions**: Some paper accounts have API restrictions
3. **Request API debugging**: IBKR can enable detailed API logging on their side

---

## üéØ **CURRENT RECOMMENDATION**

**Most likely issue**: API permission dialog or status bar showing `API: Disabled`

**Immediate action**: 
1. Check IBKR Workstation status bar for API status
2. Look for any hidden popup dialogs
3. Try the "Reset API Configuration" solution above

**If successful**: We'll immediately integrate real IBKR trading into the paper trading launcher!

*Once we get one successful API connection, the rest will work perfectly!*
