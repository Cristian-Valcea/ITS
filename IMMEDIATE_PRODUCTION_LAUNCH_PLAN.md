# 🚀 IMMEDIATE PRODUCTION LAUNCH PLAN

**Status**: Ready for Tomorrow's Smoke Run  
**Target**: 09:15-09:30 ET Window  
**Objective**: Validate Enhanced IBKR Integration → Go Live

---

## 📋 **DO THIS NOW - ONE PAGE SUMMARY**

### **1. Publish Documentation** 📚
```bash
# Handbook is ready at:
~/IntradayTrading/ITS/src/brokers/IBKR_COMPREHENSIVE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md

# TODO: Push to Confluence/SharePoint
# Tag: "v1.0—IBKR Paper-Trade Ready"
# Invite: ops, quant, SRE teams
```

### **2. Schedule Tomorrow's Smoke Run** ⏰
```bash
# Window: 09:15–09:30 ET (15 minutes)
# Test: 1-share MSFT limit order @ $400
# Monitor: Enhanced safety system in real-time

# Execute smoke run:
cd ~/IntradayTrading/ITS
source venv/bin/activate
./operator_docs/smoke_run_checklist.py
```

### **3. Governor State Management** 🛡️
```bash
# Check current status:
python operator_docs/governor_state_manager.py --status

# At 09:25 ET - Unpause governor:
python operator_docs/governor_state_manager.py --smoke-run

# Transitions: PAUSED → RUNNING (production mode)
```

### **4. Smoke Run Execution Steps** 🧪
```yaml
09:15: ./operator_docs/smoke_run_checklist.py
09:16: System health check (DB, Prometheus, Python env)
09:17: IBKR connection validation (enhanced wrapper)
09:18: Safety system component check (event monitor, risk governor)
09:20: 1-share MSFT limit order test (BUY 1 @ $400.00)
09:22: Enhanced monitoring validation (status transitions)
09:25: Governor state transition (PAUSED → RUNNING)
09:28: Capture Prometheus metrics and archive logs
09:30: Go/No-Go decision based on results
```

### **5. Success Criteria** ✅
```yaml
Critical Gates:
- ✅ IBKR connection stable (172.24.32.1 → DU8009825)
- ✅ Enhanced monitoring captures all status changes  
- ✅ Order status properly interpreted (PreSubmitted = LIVE)
- ✅ Risk governor callbacks working
- ✅ Event-driven monitoring (no polling blindness)
- ✅ Order placed and visible in IBKR Workstation

Expected Results:
- Order ID generated (e.g., 15, 16, 17)
- Status: "PreSubmitted" (LIVE ORDER, waiting for market)
- Enhanced monitoring: Real-time status transition capture
- Risk governor: Pre-order and live-order callbacks
- Logs: Complete audit trail archived
```

### **6. Post-Smoke Actions** 🎯
```bash
# If PASS (all gates green):
echo "🎉 PRODUCTION READY"
python operator_docs/governor_state_manager.py --set-state RUNNING --reason "Smoke test passed"

# If FAIL:
echo "🛑 TROUBLESHOOT REQUIRED" 
python operator_docs/governor_state_manager.py --emergency-stop
# Review logs in ~/IntradayTrading/ITS/logs/smoke_runs/
```

### **7. Archive & Document** 📊
```bash
# Logs automatically archived to:
~/IntradayTrading/ITS/logs/smoke_runs/smoke_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/

# Contains:
- smoke_run_results.json (complete results)
- smoke_run.log (detailed execution log)
- SMOKE_RUN_SUMMARY.md (executive summary)

# Upload to S3/shared storage for team review
```
