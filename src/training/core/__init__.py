Training Core Module

This module contains the core components for the training system:
- TrainerCore: Main training logic and coordination
- EnvBuilder: Environment creation and configuration
- PolicyExport: Model export and serialization
- HyperparamSearch: Hyperparameter optimization
- RiskCallbacks: Risk-aware training callbacks

These modules are internal implementation details and should not be
imported directly. Use the public API through src.training instead.
