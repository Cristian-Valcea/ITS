## 🎯 **CRITICAL SAFETY ACHIEVEMENTS**

### **1. Eliminated Blind Trading Risk**
- **Before**: Orders placed without proper monitoring (scary blind trading issue)
- **After**: Event-driven monitoring with real-time status awareness
- **Impact**: Complete order lifecycle visibility and control

### **2. Enhanced Status Interpretation**  
- **Before**: "PreSubmitted" misinterpreted as failure
- **After**: Proper interpretation (PreSubmitted = LIVE ORDER waiting)
- **Impact**: Accurate order state management and risk assessment

### **3. Risk Governor Integration**
- **Before**: No risk callbacks during order placement
- **After**: Pre-order validation and live-order monitoring
- **Impact**: Multi-layer risk protection throughout order lifecycle

### **4. Canonical WSL Connectivity**
- **Before**: "Connection reset by peer" WSL issues
- **After**: Stable connection using Windows host IP (172.24.32.1)
- **Impact**: Reliable IBKR connectivity from WSL environment
