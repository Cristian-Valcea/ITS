## 🛡️ **INSTITUTIONAL-GRADE POLISH**

### **1. Kill-Switch-as-Code**
```python
# Embedded in live trading loop
def risk_guardian():
    if mdd_today > 0.018 or pnl_3d < -200:
        logger.critical("🚨 RISK BREACH - INITIATING MODEL ROLLBACK")
        roll_back_model()
        alert_management()
        return True
    return False
```

### **2. Trade-to-Budget Mapping**
```yaml
# $12K Funding Allocation
polygon_launch_tier: $3,600  # 6-month premium data feed
gpu_compute: $4,800          # 2x A100 hours/day for 6 months  
infrastructure: $2,400       # Enhanced monitoring + storage
compliance: $1,200           # Audit tools + regulatory prep
```

### **3. Latency Histogram in Grafana**
```prometheus
# Sub-second routing proof
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(trading_decision_latency_ms[5m])) < 500
histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(order_execution_latency_ms[5m])) < 200
```

### **4. Red-Team Scenario Drill**
```bash
# Simulate simultaneous failures
Day 14 Evening: Polygon outage + IBKR disconnect simulation
Validate: Auto-failover to cached data + paper trading pause
Demo: "Even under dual-system failure, risk controls held"
```

## ⚠️ **RISK MITIGATION MATRIX**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Overfitting to 6mo data** | Medium | High | Hold-out shadow model on rolling window; daily P&L delta comparison |
| **Infrastructure drift** | Low | High | Daily GitOps diff + mandatory "green before merge" CI gates |
| **Human fatigue** | High | Medium | Automated report generation; 2-hour max manual tweaking/day |
| **Model performance regression** | Medium | High | Continuous A/B testing with automatic rollback triggers |
| **Demo day technical failure** | Low | High | 2x backup environments + rehearsed failover procedures |

## 📈 **DAILY GATE MONITORING**

### **Automated Daily Health Checks**
```bash
# Morning standup metrics (automated)
echo "📊 DAILY GATE STATUS - $(date)"
echo "🎯 Cumulative P&L: $$(get_cumulative_pnl)"
echo "📉 Current Sharpe: $(get_sharpe_ratio)"
echo "🚨 Max Drawdown: $(get_max_drawdown)%"
echo "⚡ System Uptime: $(get_uptime)%"
echo "📈 Data Quality: $(get_data_quality)%"
echo "🤖 Model Confidence: $(get_model_confidence)%"
```

### **Red/Yellow/Green Status**
- **🟢 GREEN**: All metrics within target ranges
