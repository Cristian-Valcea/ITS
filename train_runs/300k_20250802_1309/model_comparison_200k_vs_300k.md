- **HOLD_BOTH**: 0.0% (0 actions)

## 🔍 **Key Insights**

### ✅ **Improvements (200K → 300K)**
1. **Reduced Overtrading**: 31.5% fewer trades per episode (184 → 126)
2. **Better Risk Control**: Slightly lower max drawdown (0.06% → 0.05%)
3. **More Focused Strategy**: Increased concentration on SELL_BOTH action

### ⚠️ **Concerning Changes**
1. **Increased Selling Bias**: SELL_BOTH increased from 88.0% to 92.1%
2. **Lost Holding Ability**: HOLD_BOTH dropped from 0.1% to 0.0%
3. **No Profitability Improvement**: Still -0.05% average return

### 🚨 **Persistent Issues**
1. **Consistent Losses**: Both models lose exactly -0.05% per episode
2. **Zero Win Rate**: No profitable episodes in either model
3. **Deterministic Behavior**: Identical results across all episodes
4. **Extreme Selling Bias**: Both models heavily favor selling

## 📊 **Trading Behavior Analysis**

### **Trading Frequency**
- **200K Model**: 184 trades per 1000 steps (18.4% frequency)
- **300K Model**: 126 trades per 1000 steps (12.6% frequency)
- **Improvement**: 31.5% reduction in trading frequency

### **Action Diversity**
- **200K Model**: Uses 5 different actions (more diverse)
- **300K Model**: Uses 4 different actions (less diverse)
- **Change**: Slightly less diverse strategy

## 🎯 **Conclusions**

### **What the Additional 100K Steps Achieved:**
1. ✅ **Reduced overtrading** - significant improvement
2. ✅ **Slightly better risk control** - marginal improvement
3. ⚪ **No change in profitability** - still losing money
4. ❌ **Increased selling bias** - more extreme behavior

### **Root Cause Analysis:**
The fact that both models show:
- Identical returns (-0.05%)
- Zero win rates
- Deterministic behavior
- Extreme selling bias

Suggests **fundamental issues** with:
1. **Reward Function Design**: May be incentivizing selling over profitability
2. **Training Data Characteristics**: 2024-2025 period may be predominantly bearish
3. **Environment Setup**: Transaction costs or other parameters may favor selling
4. **Model Architecture**: May not be learning proper trading strategies

## 🚀 **Recommendations**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Investigate Reward Function**: 
   - Check if rewards properly incentivize profitability
   - Verify transaction cost calculations
   - Review holding vs trading incentives

2. **Analyze Training Data**:
   - Examine market conditions during 2024-2025
   - Check for data quality issues
   - Verify feature engineering

3. **Environment Validation**:
   - Test with different market periods
   - Validate transaction cost parameters
   - Check for bugs in reward calculation

### **Model Improvements:**
1. **Reward Engineering**:
   - Add profitability bonuses
   - Penalize excessive trading
   - Include risk-adjusted metrics

2. **Training Strategy**:
   - Use curriculum learning
   - Include diverse market conditions
   - Implement domain randomization

3. **Architecture Changes**:
   - Add position-aware features
   - Include market regime indicators
   - Consider ensemble methods

## 📋 **Final Assessment**

**The additional 100K steps of training showed marginal improvements in trading frequency but failed to address the fundamental profitability issues.** 

Both models appear to have learned a suboptimal strategy that consistently loses money. The slight improvements in trading frequency suggest the model is learning some aspects of risk management, but the persistent selling bias and lack of profitability indicate deeper structural issues that need to be addressed before the model can be considered viable for trading.

**Recommendation**: Focus on reward function redesign and training data analysis before additional training.
