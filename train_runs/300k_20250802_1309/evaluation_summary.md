# üß™ Model Evaluation Summary - 300K Steps

## üìä **Key Findings**

### **Performance Metrics**
- **Average Return**: -0.05% per episode
- **Win Rate**: 0.0% (no profitable episodes)
- **Max Drawdown**: 0.05%
- **Episodes Evaluated**: 20 episodes, 1000 steps each

### **Trading Behavior Analysis**
- **Total Trades**: 2,520 across 20 episodes
- **Average Trades per Episode**: 126 trades
- **Trade Frequency**: 12.6% (1 trade every 8 steps)

### **Action Distribution**
The model shows a strong bias toward selling:
- **SELL_BOTH**: 92.1% of all actions
- **SELL_NVDA_BUY_MSFT**: 3.5%
- **BUY_NVDA_HOLD_MSFT**: 2.7%
- **BUY_NVDA_SELL_MSFT**: 1.7%
- **All other actions**: 0.0%

## üîç **Analysis**

### **Concerning Patterns**
1. **Extreme Selling Bias**: 92.1% of actions are SELL_BOTH, indicating the model has learned to be overly bearish
2. **No Holding Strategy**: 0% HOLD_BOTH actions suggest the model hasn't learned to hold positions
3. **Consistent Losses**: All 20 episodes had identical -0.05% returns, suggesting deterministic behavior
4. **High Trading Frequency**: 126 trades per 1000 steps is very high, leading to transaction costs

### **Possible Causes**
1. **Reward Function Issues**: The model may be optimizing for something other than profitability
2. **Training Data Bias**: The training period may have been predominantly bearish
3. **Transaction Cost Sensitivity**: The model may have learned that selling minimizes transaction costs
4. **Overfitting**: The model may have memorized specific patterns rather than learning general trading strategies

## üéØ **Recommendations**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Review Reward Function**: Check if the reward structure incentivizes selling over holding
2. **Analyze Training Data**: Examine the market conditions during the training period (2024-2025)
3. **Test on Different Periods**: Evaluate on bullish market periods to see if behavior changes
4. **Check Transaction Costs**: Verify if transaction cost penalties are properly balanced

### **Model Improvements**
1. **Reward Engineering**: 
   - Add holding bonuses for profitable positions
   - Penalize excessive trading frequency
   - Include risk-adjusted returns in rewards

2. **Training Data Diversification**:
   - Include multiple market regimes (bull, bear, sideways)
   - Use data augmentation techniques
   - Balance training across different market conditions

3. **Architecture Considerations**:
   - Add position-aware features
   - Include market regime indicators
   - Consider ensemble methods

### **Validation Strategy**
1. **Cross-Validation**: Test on multiple time periods
2. **Market Regime Analysis**: Evaluate performance across different market conditions
3. **Benchmark Comparison**: Compare against buy-and-hold and simple strategies

## üìà **Next Steps**

1. **Diagnostic Analysis**: 
   - Run evaluation on training data to check for overfitting
   - Analyze individual episode trajectories
   - Check model confidence/uncertainty

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Adjust reward function weights
   - Modify transaction cost parameters
   - Experiment with different action spaces

3. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Consider curriculum learning
   - Implement domain randomization
   - Try different RL algorithms (SAC, TD3, etc.)

## üö® **Critical Issues**

The current model appears to have learned a suboptimal strategy that consistently loses money. This suggests fundamental issues with either:
- The reward function design
- The training data characteristics  
- The model architecture
- The hyperparameter settings

**Recommendation**: Before deploying this model, significant improvements are needed to address the selling bias and achieve profitable trading behavior.
