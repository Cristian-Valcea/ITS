**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Impact**: Advanced temporal pattern recognition with LSTM and microstructural features

## Overview

Successfully implemented **comprehensive state representation enhancements** that dramatically improve the agent's ability to integrate recent volatility patterns and reduce Q-value variance through advanced microstructural features and LSTM-based temporal modeling.

## üß† Core Enhancements

### 1. ‚úÖ Extended Lookback Sequence (3 ‚Üí 15 steps)

**Temporal Pattern Recognition Enhancement**:
- **Previous**: 3-step lookback window (limited temporal context)
- **Enhanced**: 15-step lookback window (+400% increase)
- **Benefit**: Captures longer-term volatility patterns and market dynamics
- **Integration**: Consistent across feature engineering and LSTM sequence length

```yaml
feature_engineering:
  lookback_window: 15  # Extended from 3 to 15 for better temporal patterns
```

### 2. ‚úÖ LSTM Policy Architecture (RecurrentPPO)

**Algorithm Upgrade**:
- **Previous**: QR-DQN with FlattenObservation wrapper
- **Enhanced**: RecurrentPPO with MultiInputLstmPolicy
- **Architecture**: 2-layer LSTM with 256 hidden units
- **Memory**: Separate LSTM for actor and critic networks

```yaml
training:
  algorithm: RecurrentPPO  # LSTM for temporal pattern recognition
  policy: MultiInputLstmPolicy    # LSTM policy for sequence modeling
  policy_kwargs:
    net_arch: [512, 512]          # Actor-Critic network architecture
    lstm_hidden_size: 256         # LSTM hidden state size
    n_lstm_layers: 2              # Number of LSTM layers
    shared_lstm: False            # Separate LSTM for actor and critic
    enable_critic_lstm: True      # Enable LSTM in critic network
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Advanced Microstructural Features

```

use_lstm = 'Recurrent' in algorithm or 'LSTM' in algorithm

if not use_lstm:
    env = gym.wrappers.FlattenObservation(env)  # For non-LSTM algorithms
else:
    # Skip flattening for LSTM - preserve sequence structure
    logger.info("Skipping FlattenObservation wrapper for LSTM-based algorithm")
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Algorithm Registry Updates

**RecurrentPPO Integration**:
```python
