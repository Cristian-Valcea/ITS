# 🎨 IntradayJules Performance Visualization System

## ✅ **YES! Performance plots and graphics are now fully integrated!**

Your IntradayJules system now includes comprehensive performance visualizations that automatically appear after training completion.

---

## 🎯 **What Gets Created Automatically**

### 📊 **Performance Plots Generated**:
1. **📈 Training Progress Dashboard**
   - Episode rewards over time
   - Reward distribution histogram
   - Training convergence analysis

2. **💰 Portfolio Performance Dashboard**
   - Key performance metrics summary
   - Portfolio value over time
   - Cumulative PnL chart
   - Win/Loss ratio pie chart

3. **📋 Executive Summary Dashboard**
   - Performance grade (A-F rating)
   - Risk-adjusted return metrics
   - Risk-return scatter plot
   - Key metrics summary

---

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **Automatic Integration** (Recommended):
When you run `start_training.bat`, the system now launches:
- ✅ **All monitoring tools** (TensorBoard, log monitors, etc.)
- ✅ **Post-Training Visualizer** - Waits for training completion
- ✅ **Automatic plot generation** when training finishes
- ✅ **Auto-opens plots** in your default image viewer

### **Manual Creation** (If needed):
```bash
# Create plots manually after training
create_performance_plots.bat
```

## 📁 **File Locations**

### **Generated Plots Saved To**:
```

├── NVDA_GPU_Fixed_20250715_training_143022.png     # Training progress  
└── NVDA_GPU_Fixed_20250715_portfolio_143022.png    # Portfolio performance
```

### **System Files**:
- `src/evaluation/performance_visualizer.py` - Main visualization engine
- `post_training_visualizer.py` - Auto-launcher that waits for completion
- `create_performance_plots.bat` - Manual plot creator

## 🎮 **Usage Instructions**

### **Start Training with Full Monitoring + Auto-Visualization**:
```bash
cd C:\Projects\IntradayJules
start_training.bat
```

**Note**: Uses your existing `venv` virtual environment (not venv_fresh)

**What happens**:
1. 🚀 Training starts with your command
2. 📊 All monitoring windows open (TensorBoard, logs, etc.)
3. ⏳ Post-Training Visualizer waits in background
4. ✅ When training completes, plots are automatically created
5. 🖼️ Performance plots automatically open in your image viewer

### **Manual Plot Creation** (after training):
```bash
cd C:\Projects\IntradayJules
create_performance_plots.bat
```

## 🔧 **Monitoring Windows**

When you run `start_training.bat`, you get **9 monitoring windows**:

1. **TensorBoard** (http://localhost:6006) - Real-time training metrics
2. **Log Monitor** - Live log streaming
3. **Log Tail** - Raw log output
4. **API Server** (http://localhost:8000) - System control
5. **Resource Monitor** - CPU/RAM/Disk usage
6. **Risk Audit Monitor** - Risk management events
7. **🎨 Post-Training Visualizer** - **NEW!** Waits for completion
8. **Training Progress Monitor** - Episode rewards and events
9. **Main Training Process** - Your actual training

## ⚡ **Performance Grading System**

Your plots include an **automatic performance grade** (A-F):

- **Grade A** (90-100): Sharpe ≥2.0, Drawdown ≤2%, Win Rate ≥60%
- **Grade B** (80-89): Sharpe ≥1.5, Drawdown ≤5%, Win Rate ≥55%
- **Grade C** (70-79): Sharpe ≥1.0, Drawdown ≤10%, Win Rate ≥50%
- **Grade D** (60-69): Sharpe ≥0.5, Drawdown ≤15%, Win Rate ≥45%
- **Grade F** (<60): Below minimum thresholds
