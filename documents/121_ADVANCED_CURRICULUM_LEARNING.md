# Advanced Curriculum Learning Implementation

**Date**: July 16, 2024  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Impact**: Sophisticated episode-based curriculum with performance gates and AND logic

## Overview

Successfully implemented **Advanced Curriculum Learning** with episode-based progression and performance gates, creating a sophisticated training schedule that gradually tightens risk constraints as the agent demonstrates competency. This mirrors the "gate" curricula used in recent risk-constrained RL papers.

## Curriculum Schedule

### üìö Training Stages with Performance Gates

| Stage | Episodes | Drawdown Cap | Œª (Vol Penalty) | Gate Criteria (AND Logic) |
|-------|----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **Warm-up** | 0-30 | 4.0% | 0.5 | avg_drawdown < 3.0% **AND** avg_sharpe > -0.5 |
| **Stabilise** | 31-80 | 3.0% | 1.0 | avg_drawdown < 2.25% **AND** avg_sharpe > -0.5 |
| **Tighten** | 81-130 | 2.5% | 1.5 | avg_drawdown < 1.875% **AND** avg_sharpe > -0.5 |
| **Final** | 131+ | 2.0% | 2.0 | No advancement (final stage) |

### üö™ Performance Gate Logic

**AND Logic Requirements**:
- **Drawdown Criterion**: Average drawdown < (drawdown_cap √ó 0.75)
- **Sharpe Criterion**: Average Sharpe ratio > -0.5
- **Both must be satisfied** for stage advancement

**Gate Evaluation**:
- **Window**: 10 episodes for averaging
- **Frequency**: Check every 5 episodes
- **Minimum Episodes**: Must complete minimum episodes in stage before gate check

## Technical Implementation

### 1. ‚úÖ CurriculumManager Core
**File**: `src/risk/curriculum_manager.py`

```python
class CurriculumManager:
    """Manages progressive curriculum learning with performance gates."""
    
    def record_episode_performance(self, episode, total_return, max_drawdown, 
                                 sharpe_ratio, volatility, num_trades, 
                                 final_portfolio_value):
        """Record performance and check for stage advancement."""
        
        # Check gate criteria (AND logic)
        drawdown_criterion = avg_drawdown < self.current_stage.drawdown_gate_threshold
        sharpe_criterion = avg_sharpe > self.current_stage.sharpe_gate_threshold
        
        # Advance only if BOTH criteria met
        if drawdown_criterion and sharpe_criterion:
            self._advance_to_next_stage()
```

**Key Features**:
- **Episode-based progression** (not timestep-based)
- **Performance gate evaluation** with AND logic
- **Adaptive constraint updates** during training
- **Comprehensive statistics** and monitoring

### 2. ‚úÖ CurriculumLearningCallback Integration
**File**: `src/training/core/curriculum_callback.py`

```python
class CurriculumLearningCallback(BaseCallback):
    """Callback for curriculum learning with episode-based progression."""
    
    def _on_episode_end(self):
        """Called when episode ends - record performance and check advancement."""
        
        # Calculate episode metrics
        total_return = (final_value - initial_value) / initial_value
        max_drawdown = (peak_value - min_value) / peak_value
        sharpe_ratio = mean_returns / std_returns * sqrt(252 * 390)
        
        # Record with curriculum manager
        curriculum_info = self.curriculum_manager.record_episode_performance(...)
        
        # Handle stage advancement
        if curriculum_info['advancement_info']['advanced']:
            self._update_environment_constraints()
```

**Integration Features**:
- **Real-time episode tracking** during training
- **Automatic constraint updates** when advancing stages
- **Comprehensive logging** of advancement decisions
- **Tensorboard integration** for monitoring

### 3. ‚úÖ Dynamic Environment Updates
**File**: `src/gym_env/intraday_trading_env.py`

```python
def update_risk_constraints(self, constraints: Dict[str, Any]):
    """Update risk constraints dynamically during training."""
    
    if 'drawdown_cap' in constraints:
        self.max_daily_drawdown_pct = constraints['drawdown_cap']
    
    if 'lambda_penalty' in constraints:
        # Update advanced reward shaping lambda
        if self.advanced_reward_shaper:
            new_lambda = constraints['lambda_penalty'] * 0.1
            self.advanced_reward_shaper.lagrangian_manager.lambda_value = new_lambda
```

## Configuration Integration

        episode_end: null              # Open-ended final stage
        drawdown_cap: 0.02             # 2% drawdown cap (final target)
        lambda_penalty: 2.0            # Maximum volatility penalty
        min_episodes_in_stage: 20      # Extended stability for final stage
```

### Trainer Integration

```python
# Curriculum learning callback
curriculum_config = self.risk_config.get("curriculum", {})
if curriculum_config.get("enabled", False):
    curriculum_callback = CurriculumLearningCallback(
        curriculum_config=curriculum_config,
        risk_config=self.risk_config,
        verbose=self.training_params.get("verbose", 1)
